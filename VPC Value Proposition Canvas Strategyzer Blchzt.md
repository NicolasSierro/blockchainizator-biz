## Customer Job(s)

Describe what a specific customer segment is trying to get done. It could be the tasks they are trying to perform and complete, the problems they are trying to solve, or the needs they are trying to satisfy.
- What functional jobs are you helping your customer get done?
(e.g. perform or complete a specific task, solve a specific problem, …)
- What social jobs are you helping your customer get done?
(e.g. trying to look good, gain power or status, …)
What emotional jobs are you helping your customer get done?
(e.g. esthetics, feel good, security, …)
- What basic needs are you helping your customer satisfy?
(e.g. communication, sex, …)

Besides trying to get a core job done, your customer performs ancillary jobs in different roles. Describe the jobs your customer is trying to get done as:
- Buyer
(e.g. trying to look good, gain power or status, …)
- Co-creator
(e.g. esthetics, feel good, security, …)
- Transferrer
(e.g. products and services that help customers dispose of a product, transfer it to others, or resell, …).

Rank each job according to its significance to your customer. Is it crucial or is it trivial? For each job indicate how often it occurs. Outline in which specific context a job is done, because that may impose constraints or limitations. (e.g. while driving, outside, …)

## Pains
Describe negative emotions, undesired costs and situations, and risks that your customer experiences or could experience before, during, and after getting the job done.
- What does your customer find too costly?
(e.g. takes a lot of time, costs too much money, requires substantial efforts, …)
- What makes your customer feel bad?
(e.g. frustrations, annoyances, things that give them a headache, …)
- How are current solutions underperforming for your customer?
(e.g. lack of features, performance, malfunctioning, …)
- What are the main difficulties and challenges your customer encounters?
(e.g. understanding how things work, difficulties getting things done, resistance, …)
- What negative social consequences does your customer encounter or fear?
(e.g. loss of face, power, trust, or status, …)
- What risks does your customer fear?
(e.g. financial, social, technical risks, or what could go awfully wrong, …)
- What’s keeping your customer awake at night?
(e.g. big issues, concerns, worries, …)
- What common mistakes does your customer make?
(e.g. usage mistakes, …)
- What barriers are keeping your customer from adopting solutions?
(e.g. upfront investment costs, learning curve, resistanceto change, …)

Rank each pain according to the intensity it represents for your customer. Is it very intense or is it very light.  For each pain indicate how often it occurs.

## Gains
Describe the benefits your customer expects, desires or would be surprised by.  
This includes functional utility, social gains, positive emotions, and cost savings.
- Which savings would make your customer happy?
(e.g. in terms of time, money and effort, …)
- What outcomes does your customer expect and what would go beyond his/her expectations?
(e.g. quality level, more of something, less of something, …)
- How do current solutions delight your customer?
(e.g. specific features, performance, quality, …)
- What would make your customer’s job or life easier?
(e.g. flatter learning curve, more services, lower cost of ownership, …)
- What positive social consequences does your customer desire?
(e.g. makes them look good, increase in power, status, …)
- What are customers looking for?
(e.g. good design, guarantees, specific or more features, …)
- What do customers dream about?
(e.g. big achievements, big reliefs, …)
- How does your customer measure success and failure?
(e.g. performance, cost, …)
- What would increase the likelihood of adopting a solution?
(e.g. lower cost, less investments, lower risk, better quality, performance, design, …)

Rank each gain according to its relevance to your customer. Is it substantial or is it insignificant?  
For each gain indicate how often it occurs.

## Products & Services
List all the products and services your value proposition is built around.  
Which products and services do you offer that help your customer get either a functional, social, or emotional job done, or help him/her satisfy basic needs?

- Co-creator
(e.g. products and services that help customers co-design solutions, otherwise contribute value to the solution, …)
- Transferrer
(e.g. products and services that help customers dispose of a product, transfer it to others, or resell, …)

Products and services may either be
- tangible (e.g. manufactured goods, face-to-face customer service),
digital/virtual (e.g. downloads, online recommendations),
